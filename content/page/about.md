I am a final-year Ph.D. student at Seoul National University,
advised by [Chung-Kil Hur](https://sf.snu.ac.kr/gil.hur/).
Previously, I received B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from Seoul National University.

My research interests lie in programming languages, concurrency, and software verification.
In particular, I am interested in building formal foundations for
writing, compiling, and verifying concurrent software under weak consistency.
To this end, I have been 
designing relaxed memory models for programming languages and hardware architectures
([Promising 2.0](https://sf.snu.ac.kr/promising2.0/),
[Promising-ARM](https://sf.snu.ac.kr/promising-arm-riscv/),
[Persistent memory](https://cp.kaist.ac.kr/pmem)),
verifying compiler optimizations under weak memory
([SEQ](https://sf.snu.ac.kr/promising-seq/)),
and studying fundamental principles in writing concurrent programs
([Local DRF](https://sf.snu.ac.kr/promising-ldrf/)).

**I am on the job market this year, looking forward to working on
programming languages, concurrency, compilers, or verification.
Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions!**
