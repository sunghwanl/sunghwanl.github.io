I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the Software Foundations Lab. at Seoul National University,
advised by [Chung-Kil Hur](https://sf.snu.ac.kr/gil.hur/).
Previously, I received B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from Seoul National University.

My research interests lie in the area of
programming languages, relaxed memory concurrency, and software verification.
In particular, I am mainly interested in building formal foundations for
writing, compiling, and verifying concurrent software under weakly consistent shared-memory.
To this end, I have been working on
designing relaxed memory models for programming languages and hardware architectures
([Promising 2.0](https://sf.snu.ac.kr/promising2.0/),
[Promising-ARM](https://sf.snu.ac.kr/promising-arm-riscv/), and
[Persistent memory](https://cp.kaist.ac.kr/pmem)),
developing reasoning principles for validating and verifying compiler optimizations under weak memory
([SEQ](https://sf.snu.ac.kr/promising-seq/)),
and studying fundamental programmability guarantees in relaxed memory concurrency
([Local DRF](https://sf.snu.ac.kr/promising-ldrf/)).
